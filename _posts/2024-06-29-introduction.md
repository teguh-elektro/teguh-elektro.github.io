# Hello everyone!

My name is Teguh Setiawan. I was born and raised in Pekanbaru, a city known as "Kota Bertuah" I’m excited to share a little bit about myself here.

In my day-to-day life, I work as a web developer. My job involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. Every project I work on presents new and interesting challenges, and I really enjoy the process of crafting digital solutions that are both effective and meaningful. For me, every line of code is an opportunity to create something new and useful.

Outside of work, I have a deep passion for DIY electronics. This hobby has been a part of my life since I was in middle school. From assembling simple kits to working on more complex electronics projects, each endeavor gives me a great sense of accomplishment when completed. This hobby not only sharpens my technical skills but also offers a chance to relax and unleash my creativity.

In addition to electronics, I am also very interested in web programming. I believe that learning is a never-ending journey, and every day I strive to discover new knowledge and improve my programming skills. Through this website, I aim to share the knowledge, tips, and experiences I’ve gained in the field of web development.

I also occasionally enjoy traveling and exploring new places. Traveling provides fresh perspectives and valuable experiences. I plan to share some of my travel stories here, with the hope that they can inspire and inform those of you who also love to explore the world.

Thank you so much for visiting my website. Here, I will document and share my experiences related to my DIY electronics hobby, web programming, and a bit of my travel adventures. I hope this blog can be useful and inspiring for all of you.

Warm regards,

**Teguh Setiawan**
